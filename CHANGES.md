# Changes

## 0.2.0.2 ->

Minor breaking changes to `ksp::orbit::Orbit`:
* `orbit.apoapsis` and `orbit.apoapsis_radius` are now `Option<float>` instead of just `float`
  * This is because apoapsis of a hyperbolic orbit is pretty much undefined.
  * If you are sure that you are only dealing with elliptic orbits, you can just replace `orbit.apoapsis` with `orbit.apoapsis.value` in your code.
  * This might by a small inconvenience, but should be an incentive to check for the `eccentricy` in your calculations
* `orbit.next_apoapsis_time()` and `orbit.next_time_of_radius()` now also return `Option<float>` to be consistent
* `orbit.u_t_at_mean_anomaly()` has been renamed to `orbit.ut_at_mean_anomaly()`
* Removed `orbit.absolute_position(ut)` as it was misleading. Use `orbit.global_position(ut)` instead.

## 0.2.0.1 -> 0.2.0.2

* Add debug billboards
* Add debug paths

## 0.1.9.3 -> 0.2.0.1

* Add API for coordinate system independent positions, velocities, vectors and rotations
* Debug vectors and ground markers
* More atmospheric telemetry data
* Support for string arguments
* Add binding for parachutes
* Add navball helper functions to `std::navball`

## 0.1.9.2 -> 0.1.9.3

* Fix main window rescale on resize
* Improve error message on invalid number of method arguments
* Add binding for decoupler and launch clamps
* Fixed mixing async function results with sync methods (issue 32)
* Add `pitch_yaw_roll` property to `vessel` reflecting the navball angles

## 0.1.9 -> 0.1.9.2

* Potentially fixed reload/revert issue
* Add bindings for solar panels
* Add bindings for fairings
* Improve handling of code generation bugs

## 0.1.8 -> 0.1.9

* Add basic ingame script editor (thanks to ThunderousEcho)
  * Note: There is an issue of IMGUI elements not capturing the keyboard focus. As a temporary workaround there is a toggle to disable keyboard control of the game
* Add the ability to add additional arguments to scripts (thanks to kbleeke).
  * As an example the `launch_rocket` script has now a `target_apoapsis` argument
* Experimental: Add `change_mode` to ModuleEngine
* Fix for `bool != bool`
* Check that it still works with game version 0.1.1.0
  * Known issue: After a reload it might happen that the reference to the active vessel is lost. A "Reboot" can fix that.

## 0.1.7 -> 0.1.8

* Add `.reverse()` on arrays
* Fix internal error if function is called with too many arguments (now correct error message is displayed)
* Update all the steering / throttle managers in `ksp::control` (see https://kontrolsystem2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interact/control.html)

## 0.1.6 -> 0.1.7

* `vessel.actions.sas = true/false` now working
* `vessel.actions.rcs = true/false` now working
* Add `vessel.actions.custom1` .. `vessel.actions.custom10` (addresses #10)
* Support array of arrays types (addresses #12)
* Add engine mode information (addresses #12)


## 0.1.5 -> 0.1.6

* Add `vessel.situtation` binding (Addressing #8)
* Made coordinate transformation more stable (try always to be in coordinate frame of the main body, addresses #4)
* Optimize the parsing/compiling speed
* Add addition scripting director "localTo2" to cleanly distinguish between scripts provided by by the plugin and scripts you write your own
  * This can be modified in the public configuration `/BepInEx/config/com.github.untoldwind.KontrolSystem2.cfg`

## 0.1.4 -> 0.1.5

* Minor language adjustments
  * Tweak precedence of the range operator `..` and `...` so that it more consistent
  * Handle final return statement in functions correctly
* Added null checks in the `AutopilotAdapter` (addressing issue #3) 
* Added `core::std` package with string `join` and `format` functions
* The formatting is based on C# `String.Format`, so something like this works:
  
```format("First: {0,7:F3}, Second: {1,7:F2}, Third: {2}", (1.1234567, 12.345678, "Hallo")))```
gives "First:   1.123, Second:   12.35, Third: Hallo"


## 0.1.3 -> 0.1.4

* Combined Toolbar window and Modulemanager window to one
  * ... i.e. got rid of the window that had little to no purpose
* Added an `exepect_orbit` to the maneuvering node
* Added `parts_in_stage` to staging information
* Improved the `exec_node` script (a lot)

## 0.1.2 -> 0.1.3

* Close windows on ESC menu
* Fix `vessel.stating.next()` to actually work
* Made a `launch_rocket` script working (for at least one rocket)

## 0.1.1 -> 0.1.2

* Re-adding the unit tests that where failing on windows
* Add hotkey "Alt-K" to open the main window even if toolbar is not present/visible
  * Can be toggled of in BepInEx configuration manager
* Increase internal line length of console
* Add `ksp::vessel::Vessel.staging.next()` method to trigger staging
* Fix throttle_manager unhook problem
  * Should eventually work for all other control managers as well
* Ignore empty lines on console resize
* Add indicator light to main window
* Additional vessel information (thanks EloxZ)
